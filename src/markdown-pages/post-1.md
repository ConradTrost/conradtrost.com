## Welcome to Me.

Hello, my name is Conrad Trost. I am a freelance web developer focused on MERN stack (specifically Gatsby.js).

## I Am Not Passionate About Web Dev.

Let me start by stating that I am not specifically passionate about web development. I am passionate about expanding a company, or persons, reach into the virtual world. Whether it be e-Commerce, services, B2B sales, local musicians, an artists portfolio... It's about *visibility*. That's what I do. Let me explain...

The rest of the world is progressing and having a website is now a necessity. Not just any website though, it needs to be fast. It needs to be competitive. I am just the person that establishes that. I have found that I have a knack for it, actually. Making things fast is what I'm good at.
