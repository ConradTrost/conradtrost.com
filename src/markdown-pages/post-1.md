## Welcome to Me

Hello, my name is Conrad Trost. I am a freelance web developer focused on MERN stack (specifically Gatsby.js).

## I Am Not Passionate About Web Dev

Let me start by stating that I am not specifically passionate about web development. I am passionate about expanding a company, or persons, reach into the virtual world. Whether it be e-Commerce, services, B2B sales, local musicians, an artists portfolio... It's about *visibility*. That's what I do. Let me explain...

The rest of the world is progressing and having a website is now a necessity. Not just any website though, it needs to be fast. It needs to be competitive. I am just the person that establishes that. I have found that I have a knack for it, actually. Making things fast is what I'm good at.

## Get to Know Me

I am a guy that gets bored easily, therefore I have many interests. I have been playing guitar since I was 8 years old and have been playing piano for a few years as well. I enjoy hiking, skiing, and playing/training with my dog, Koda (German Shepherd).
My favorite song is split between When the Music's Over by The Doors, The Red Sea by The Summit, and Minor Swing by Hot Club of Cowtown. My favorite album is Let It Bleed - The Rolling Stones, and my favorite artist is Shakey Graves. 

I went to college at **Texas A&M University** for a short while until I realized that their engineering program is an actual shit-show. I then applied for coding bootcamps and accepted a 6 month program, Full Stack Web Development - University of Texas at Austin.
This program was focused on MongoDB, Express, React, and Node (MERN). I found myself to really enjoy messing around with React and continued to further my studies in both React and computer science fundamentals. I am also currently in the process of advancing my knowledge of TypeScript and Swift.

## Marketing

Nowadays, I work as a Freelance Web Developer for both small and large projects. 
I maintain multiple million-dollar e-Commerce websites, and I've created various websites for insurance agencies, real estate agencies, local musicians, construction companies, etc.

Due to my background in digital marketing, I'm able to optimize SEO and make a company competitive when it comes to Google rankings, exponentially growing the website traffic and achieve a higher conversion rate. 
I have experience targeting specific keywords that lead to high click-through-rates on dynamic content, and following Google's preferred website layouts for increased visibility and consumer retention.
